"""
Workspace management views (tenancy Stage 0 plumbing → Stage 4 RBAC).

Stage 4 makes management role-based: an Owner/Admin of a workspace (or any
superuser) may rename it, manage its members, and (Owner only) delete it.
Plain members may use a workspace's resources but not manage it. Creating a NEW
workspace stays an instance-level act (superuser only) — provisioning a tenant
is not a per-workspace role action; the creator becomes its Owner, and a
superuser can hand ownership to a user via the members UI.

Gating contract (consistent with the rest of tenancy):
- superuser ⇒ may do anything, in any workspace (cross-workspace god);
- a NON-member targeting a workspace ⇒ 404 (no existence disclosure — the URL is
  never trusted), exactly like the active-workspace middleware;
- a member without the required role ⇒ 403 (they can see the workspace but lack
  the privilege).
